flag : -1  means that it is an old process and it isn't allowed to allocate on it untill user deallocate it.
flag : 0 means that it is a free part 
flag :  any number for example 8 ,  means that this parts is allocated for segment of process 8 

name : should be set to the name of incommming segment 

to use Stl list you should use #include<list>

to insernt in stl list , you should use iterator to list and the value that we want to insert :
example :
we have list of 3 items 2 2 2 
list <int> list1; 
list<int>::iterator it = list1.begin(); 
we want to insert 5 in the third postition
we have to make the iterator poing to the begin of list , then use advance finction with the iterator to make it point to the third postion which means index 2 
dvance(it,2);
list1.insert(it,5); 
list after insertion 
2 2 5 2

so for our case if we want to insert in the third position :

list<hole> list1;
hole H1;
list<hole>::iterator it = list1.begin();
dvance(it,2); 
list1.insert(it,H1); 

also iteration can be used to traverse the list 

for (list<hole>::iterator it = list1.begin();it != list1.end();it++)
{
iterator like pointer we have to dereferecne it to get its values ;
to dereferance the iterator we use (*it).get_name() for example or it->get_name() 
}
